What info do I want to see, and in what format? What's missing from Garmin App displays?
    - I'd like to see how my sleep score, activity level (intensity mins?), sun exposure (solar charging), HRV,
        and stress levels correlate and change over time, maybe over the course of a week. 
    - How granular should my sleep score be? Bar chart of light,deep,rem,and awake time for each day?
    - Overlay this with stress, daily intensity minutes, sun exposure, HRV
    - Change Graph shading for Day/night times. 
    - Smoothing? Implement some sort of rolling average for stress, 

Rough Draft is looking good, to do:
    -Think about whether or not calories in/out makes sense
    -Dual y axis labels? Stress and BPM?
    -Do I want weight somewhere in here? Which chart? Calories In/Out dual y axis
    -Clean up pandas setting with copy warnings.
